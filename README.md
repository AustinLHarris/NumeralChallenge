# NumeralChallenge
This project took me 2 hours to complete (from 3:10 to 5:10 on 4/8/2022)

I completed it in IntelliJ IDEA

To run the java file I used Git bash. As is, to run from the command line, it requires 2 arguments after the command ex: java RomanNumeral.java hello java.
Those two arguments have no impact on the application and with more time I could quickly change that but I think this is a trivial issue. If needed I am happy to fix it
